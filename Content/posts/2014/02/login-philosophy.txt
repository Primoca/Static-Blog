{"MarkdownText":"When you sign up with Primoca, you don't pick a username and password like most websites. We only use third party OAUTH logins and here's why.\r\n\r\nPasswords Everywhere\r\n-----\r\nPasswords have long been a difficult security problem. People have trouble remembering passwords so they choose one that is memorable but that also means it is typically a weak password. Since so many websites require credentials the same weak password gets used in multiple places. \r\n\r\nSecuring passwords on the server side is also a challenge. Best practices suggest hashing with a salt and using a computationally slow algorithm. Security breaches are announced often (even for high profile websites) and reveal that many sites are not using the best practices. Since people reuse passwords on many websites one site's poor security can compromise a person's accounts all over the web.\r\n\r\nFederated Third Party Logins\r\n----------\r\nPrimoca has taken a different approach. Passwords can't be stolen from Primoca because we never store them. Currently we accept 4 OAUTH login providers (Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook). OAUTH works by redirecting to the providers site for login then receiving a token to prove authentication. Passwords never touch our servers. We also don't have to implement workflows for forgot password or multi-factor authentication. There's really no need for us to be an identity provider. \r\n\r\nIn addition to security there are a number of user experience benefits too. User signup is extremely fast when you don't have to create a new password and name and email is automatically populated. No tedious forms to fill out. If you're already logged in with your identity provider (say with Gmail) you don't have to enter your password again so login is almost instantaneous. This is especially seamless on mobile where the OS can be aware of your identity account and automatically login to websites.\r\n\r\nA secure and fast signup and login process is key to our commitment to providing the highest performance web hosting on the planet.","Date":"2014-02-06T11:01:32","Tags":"Security","TagList":["Security"],"Title":"Login Philosophy","Author":"Alex Thompson","FullId":"2014/02/login-philosophy/","DateId":"2014/02/","TitleId":"login-philosophy"}
