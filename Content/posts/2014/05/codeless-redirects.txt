{"MarkdownText":"HTTP redirects are an important part of website maintenance that typically require the custom code of a dynamic website. Primoca lets you easily configure redirects on static websites with no code.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"centerAlign v450\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;display:inline-block;font-family:'Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;color:#a7a7a7;font-size:11px;\"><iframe src=\"//embed.gettyimages.com/embed/sb10069931a-001?et=nOGGryK5SJ9F-TfEGSsT3A&sig=gxsvHwZ_e0p1rO8ZggIKcyjIWdLiDwTkz47Ra-urzjA=\" width=\"406\" height=\"471\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"display:inline-block;\"></iframe><p style=\"margin:0;\"></p><div style=\"padding:0;margin:-6px 0 4px 10px;text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/sb10069931a-001\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#a7a7a7;text-decoration:none;font-weight:normal !important;border:none;\">#sb10069931a-001</a> / <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color:#a7a7a7;text-decoration:none;font-weight:normal !important;border:none;\">gettyimages.com</a></div></div></div>\r\n\r\nThe Web Never Forgets\r\n--------\r\nWhen you publish content with a unique URL, search engines and other websites link to that URL to provide direct navigation. At some point you may decide to reorganize your website and its URLs. To prevent the external links and search engine rankings from breaking, a request to the old URL should respond with an HTTP redirect to the new URL that the browser or search engine bot will automatically follow.\r\n\r\nRedirects are implemented with HTTP status codes. The most common redirect codes are 301 and 302 which have slightly different use cases. 301 is for permanent redirects where the requester should forget the old URL and always use the new one. 302 is for temporary redirects where the requester should continue to try the old URL in the future.\r\n\r\nSay No to Dynamic Websites\r\n-----------\r\nMany web development frameworks can be programmed to respond with a 301 or 302 but that requires running server side code for your website. For a static website  its frustrating to have to change to a dynamic website just to get redirects. That's why Primoca lets you set redirects on each URL through our control panel with no coding. \r\n\r\nRedirects aren't the only status codes you can set. 404 and 410 are also available and quite useful. 404 is the most common code for not found and is a broad catch all for when a resource is not available for whatever reason. 410 means gone and can be used in situations where the resource is permanently not found and requesters can delete the link to the URL.\r\n\r\nOne thing Primoca purposely doesn't have is a URL delete button. Once a URL exists you can only change the HTTP status code response. This may seem strange compared to other web hosts that have delete like a traditional file system. Since the web never forgets we feel its better to guide you into the best practice of deciding the appropriate status code for that old URL.\r\n\r\nThese features are just another example of Primoca's commitment to bring you the simplest and most powerful web hosting on the planet.","Date":"2014-05-23T20:44:06","Tags":"Static_Websites","TagList":["Static_Websites"],"Title":"Codeless Redirects","Author":"Alex Thompson","FullId":"2014/05/codeless-redirects/","DateId":"2014/05/","TitleId":"codeless-redirects"}
