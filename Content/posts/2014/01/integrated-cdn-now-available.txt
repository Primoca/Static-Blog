{"MarkdownText":"Every static website hosted on Primoca is now automatically configured with a content delivery network (CDN) to provide maximum performance.\r\n\r\nWhy a CDN?\r\n---------\r\nWhen a user requests a web page it takes time for the data to travel between the server and the client. Data can travel near the speed of light across the internet but even though that sounds fast it can amount to a few hundred milliseconds to go half way around the earth. Since a web page is composed of multiple files (HTML, CSS, JS, images) it takes several round trips to view a single page. With all this back and forth the total load time can quickly balloon to several seconds resulting in a sluggish user experience. \r\n\r\nIdeally you want load times under one second for a website to feel fast. Since you can't move data faster than the speed of light the next best option is to put the data closer to the users. This is the point of a CDN. A network of servers all over the world that hold copies of your content so it can be served to users nearby as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nCache Control\r\n---------\r\nStatic files are ideal for CDN acceleration because well... they're static, as in they don't change often or maybe ever. The longer they don't change the longer they can stay cached at the edge servers or in a user's browser. This caching reduces the round trips to render a page giving us more of that speed we love so much.\r\n\r\nTo tell the CDN and the browser how long it can hold on to a file before checking if it changed we have the HTTP `Cache-Control` and `Expires` headers. Primoca lets you control these headers on a per file basis to get the maximum performance and flexibility from your website.\r\n\r\nRobust Infrastructure\r\n-----------\r\nPrimoca uses Amazon Web Services Cloudfront as its CDN backbone giving you rock solid reliability. The CDN has many strategically placed edge locations worldwide engineered for high performance and scalability. The origin servers for your files and control panel are also designed for high availability so your site never goes down.\r\n\r\nThese improvements are just one more step in Primoca's commitment to bringing you the easiest and highest performance web hosting experience on the planet.
